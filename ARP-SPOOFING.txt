5. Detect ARP Spoofing

Objective: Identify fake ARP responses to prevent MITM attacks.

Steps:

1.	Monitor ARP responses on the network.
2.	Compare the MAC addresses to detect inconsistencies.

Code:

from scapy.all import sniff, ARP

def detect_arp_spoof(packet):
    if packet.haslayer(ARP) and packet.op == 2:
        real_mac = packet.hwsrc
        print(f"Possible ARP Spoofing: {packet.psrc} has MAC {real_mac}")

print("Monitoring ARP packets...")
sniff(filter="arp", prn=detect_arp_spoof, store=False)


Output:

Possible ARP Spoofing: 192.168.1.1 has MAC AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
