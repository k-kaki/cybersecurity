1. Port Scanner

Objective: Scan a target system for open ports to identify potential vulnerabilities.

Steps:

1.	Install Python and use the socket library.
2.	Input the target IP address and port range.
3.	Try to connect to each port and check if it is open.

Code:

import socket

def port_scan(target, start_port, end_port):
    print(f"Scanning {target} for open ports...")
    for port in range(start_port, end_port + 1):
        s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        s.settimeout(1)
        result = s.connect_ex((target, port))
        if result == 0:
            print(f"Port {port} is open")
        s.close()

# Example usage
target_ip = input("Enter target IP: ")
port_scan(target_ip, 1, 100)


Output:

Scanning 192.168.1.1 for open ports...
Port 22 is open
Port 80 is open
